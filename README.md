We started off by revisiting the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in C++, focusing on how to structure code across multiple files using header files and Makefiles. 

After that, we implemented shape classes like Rectangle, Square, Circle, and Ellipse, and tied them together using a common Shape base class. This gave us solid practice with inheritance, polymorphism, and designing for extensibility. We also added support for coordinates and a getShape() method to identify each type. While building this, we learned the importance of avoiding code duplication and writing modular, clean code that’s easy to extend.

Later, we shifted focus to design — specifically using UML diagrams to plan our class structures before jumping into code. This made the implementation phase much more straightforward. We then created a Canvas class to manage multiple shapes and used SFML to display them graphically. Each shape handles its own rendering, which keeps the display logic modular and easy to manage.
